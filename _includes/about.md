## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm <a href="https://dashandong.github.io" title="HomePage">Dashan Dong</a> | <a href="https://translate.google.com/details?sl=zh-CN&tl=en&text=è‘£%20å¤§%20å±±&op=translate" title="HomePage">è‘£å¤§å±±</a>

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow
at professor [Ji-Xin Cheng's lab](https://sites.bu.edu/cheng-group/),
in the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/departments-and-divisions/electrical-and-computer-engineering/),
[Boston University](https://www.bu.edu).

My research is primarily focused on developing advanced _**label-free microscope**_ for biomedical imaging.
My projects have been related to modeling light propagation/scattering in theory, modulating light field in experiments, and computational imaging of live cells in application.
Moreover, my work is also related with _ultrafast optics_ and _spectroscopy_.

I am now working on developing _mid-infrared photothermal (MIP)_ microscopy for live cell imaging.
MIP enables a spectroscopic imaging at molecular vibrational fingerprint region, while detecting the transient thermal change at visable resolution.
It offers an opportunity for label-free observation of subcelluar dynamics with molecular specificity.

I am currently an Associate Research Fellow in Optics at [Institude of Modern Optics](http://optics.pku.edu.cn), [School of Physics](http://english.phy.pku.edu.cn), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn). My research is primarily focused on developing advanced _label-free microscope_ for biomedical imaging. My projects have been related to modeling light propagation/scattering in theory, modulating light field in experiments, and computational imaging of live cells in application. Moreover, my work is also related with _ultrafast optics_ and _spectroscopy_.
